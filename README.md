# Jeston Nano GPIO with Socket

This repo contains my python scripts to set Jetson Nano GPIOs.




## This repo contains:

- GPIO_test.py -> A basic script to set all the jetson GPIOs manually

- GPIO_socket.py -> This script can get 4 GPIOs from socket in a server mode and send the status back. the code will be useful when you're main code on Jetson is running on C++ and you want to have a Python driver to get data and drive Jetson GPIOs.
